# Tweests_classification
NLP TF-IDF 

During the 2016 election, Donald Trump used Twitter very actively. There is a theory out there
that, since he was known to use an Android phone, that all Android tweets were from Trump,
and all iPhone tweets were sent by someone on his staff.

For our purposes, I assumed that Android tweets are Trump tweets and iPhone
tweets are from his staff. Tweets from other devices (web, ipad, etc.) are not known
to be one or the other.

We developed a classifier that distinguishes between the two
types of tweets

I tried to run our classifier on 2018 tweets but the features have changed, so we classified by using only the text (TF-IDF approach).
